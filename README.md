# You-Snooze-You-Share

  You Snooze You Share is an original iOS app created by a group of college freshmen as a final project for Harvard's CS50. Our reimagined alarm clock leverages the power of social media to wake the user up. Each alarm triggers a dialogue box with 2 options--"Post" or "Cancel." The only way to snooze is by pressing "Post", which results in an embarrassing tweet on the user's Twitter account and automatically reschedules another alarm for 5 minutes later. In addition, the app has the full functionality of a normal alarm clock, including scheduling, editing, and deleting alarms. The visual display is designed in a similar style as the original Apple Alarm Clock.
  
  The app is written in [Swift 3] (https://developer.apple.com/swift/), and we worked with the [Twitter API] (https://dev.twitter.com/docs) to implement the posting feature. We're excited to provide support for other social media platforms in the future, such as Facebook and Instagram, as well as implement other types of incentives!
